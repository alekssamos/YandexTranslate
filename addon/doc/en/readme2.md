New 4: By popular demand added DeepL API for translation . Select DeepL from the API combobox in the add-on settings.

New 3: added the ability to save translates to the cache. If you need it, check the appropriate box in the add-on settings.

New 2: Starting with the version from October 5, 2021,
by default, requests will go through my server.
This should improve the service for you, since Yandex blocks some IP addresses.
You can always disable this in the settings by changing the API type to web or iOS.

New: If it doesn't work, an error occurred when creating the key or something 
such,
then open the NVDA Menu, Tools, Yandex Translate Settings
and install the API on iOS.
These keys are used in the iPhone app and have not changed for more than 6 months,
it should work better and more stable.

The addon translates the selected text fragment or content from the clipboard, there is an automatic (instant) translation of NVDA speech.

If there is a braille display, the result will be duplicated on it as well.
